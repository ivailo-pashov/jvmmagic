/**
 * A class or interface type T will be initialized immediately before the first occurrence of any one of the following:
 *
 * T is a class and an instance of T is created.
 * A static method declared by T is invoked.
 * A static field declared by T is assigned.
 * A static field declared by T is used and the field is not a constant variable (ยง4.12.4).
 * T is a top level class (ยง7.6) and an assert statement (ยง14.10) lexically nested within T (ยง8.1.3) is executed.
 *
 * Invocation of certain reflective methods in class Class and in package java.lang.reflect also causes class or interface initialization.
 * A class or interface will not be initialized under any other circumstance.
